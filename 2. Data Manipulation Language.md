## 2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
Data Manipulation Language (DML) is a subset of SQL used for managing data within database objects. It focuses on querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data in tables. Here's a look at the main DML commands:

### 1. SELECT Command
The `SELECT` command is used to query data from one or more tables. It can retrieve specific columns and rows based on various conditions.

#### Basic Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

#### Examples

**Retrieve All Columns**
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```
- Retrieves all columns from the `Employees` table.

**Retrieve Specific Columns**
```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees;
```
- Retrieves only the `FirstName` and `LastName` columns from the `Employees` table.

**Using WHERE Clause**
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE LastName = 'Smith';
```
- Retrieves all rows where the `LastName` is 'Smith'.

**Ordering Results**
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName ASC;
```
- Retrieves all rows ordered by `LastName` in ascending order.

**Using JOIN**
```sql
SELECT Employees.FirstName, Departments.DepartmentName
FROM Employees
INNER JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
```
- Combines rows from `Employees` and `Departments` where the `DepartmentID` matches.

**Aggregate Functions**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(EmployeeID) AS NumberOfEmployees FROM Employees;
```
- Returns the total number of employees.

### 2. INSERT Command
The `INSERT` command is used to add new rows to a table.

#### Basic Syntax
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

#### Examples

**Insert a Single Row**
```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, BirthDate)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', '1980-01-01');
```
- Adds a new row to the `Employees` table.

**Insert Multiple Rows**
```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, BirthDate)
VALUES 
(2, 'Jane', 'Smith', '1985-02-20'),
(3, 'Mike', 'Johnson', '1979-07-10');
```
- Adds multiple rows in one command.

### 3. UPDATE Command
The `UPDATE` command is used to modify existing rows in a table.

#### Basic Syntax
```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

#### Examples

**Update Specific Rows**
```sql
UPDATE Employees
SET LastName = 'Doe', Email = 'johndoe@example.com'
WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
```
- Updates the `LastName` and `Email` of the employee with `EmployeeID` 1.

**Update All Rows**
```sql
UPDATE Employees
SET DepartmentID = 2;
```
- Sets the `DepartmentID` to 2 for all employees.

### 4. DELETE Command
The `DELETE` command is used to remove rows from a table.

#### Basic Syntax
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

#### Examples

**Delete Specific Rows**
```sql
DELETE FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
```
- Deletes the row with `EmployeeID` 1 from the `Employees` table.

**Delete All Rows**
```sql
DELETE FROM Employees;
```
- Deletes all rows from the `Employees` table but retains the table structure.

### Additional Concepts

#### WHERE Clause
The `WHERE` clause is crucial in DML commands for specifying which rows should be affected. It supports various conditions using operators like `=`, `<>`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`, `IN`, and logical operators like `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`.

#### JOIN Types
- **INNER JOIN**: Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN** (or **LEFT OUTER JOIN**): Returns all rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table. Non-matching rows from the right table will contain NULL.
- **RIGHT JOIN** (or **RIGHT OUTER JOIN**): Returns all rows from the right table and the matched rows from the left table. Non-matching rows from the left table will contain NULL.
- **FULL JOIN** (or **FULL OUTER JOIN**): Returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables. Non-matching rows will contain NULL on the side where there is no match.

#### Aggregate Functions
- **COUNT()**: Returns the number of rows that match the specified criteria.
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees;
  ```
- **SUM()**: Returns the total sum of a numeric column.
  ```sql
  SELECT SUM(Salary) FROM Employees;
  ```
- **AVG()**: Returns the average value of a numeric column.
  ```sql
  SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees;
  ```
- **MIN()**: Returns the smallest value of the selected column.
  ```sql
  SELECT MIN(Salary) FROM Employees;
  ```
- **MAX()**: Returns the largest value of the selected column.
  ```sql
  SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employees;
  ```

#### GROUP BY Clause
The `GROUP BY` clause groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into aggregate data.
```sql
SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfEmployees
FROM Employees
GROUP BY DepartmentID;
```
- Groups employees by `DepartmentID` and counts the number of employees in each department.

#### HAVING Clause
The `HAVING` clause is used to filter groups based on aggregate functions.
```sql
SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfEmployees
FROM Employees
GROUP BY DepartmentID
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
```
- Only includes departments with more than 10 employees in the result.

### Summary
DML commands are essential for manipulating data within a database. They provide the functionality to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data, ensuring that users can effectively manage and utilize the information stored in relational databases. Proper use of DML commands allows for efficient and accurate data operations, forming the core of day-to-day database management tasks.
