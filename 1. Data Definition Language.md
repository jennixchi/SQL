## 1. Data Definition Language (DDL)
Data Definition Language (DDL) is a subset of SQL used to define, alter, and manage the structure of database objects such as tables, indexes, and views. DDL commands are crucial for setting up the schema and ensuring the structural integrity of the database. Here is an overview of the main DDL commands and their usage:

### 1. CREATE Command
The `CREATE` command is used to create new database objects. This includes databases, tables, indexes, views, and other objects.

#### Creating a Database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE SchoolDB;
```
- This command creates a new database named `SchoolDB`.

#### Creating a Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    LastName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    BirthDate DATE,
    EnrollmentDate DATE
);
```
- `StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY`: Defines a column `StudentID` as an integer and sets it as the primary key.
- `FirstName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL`: Defines a `FirstName` column that cannot be null and can store up to 100 characters.
- `LastName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL`: Similar to `FirstName`.
- `BirthDate DATE`: Defines a `BirthDate` column as a date type.
- `EnrollmentDate DATE`: Defines an `EnrollmentDate` column as a date type.

#### Creating an Index
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_lastname ON Students (LastName);
```
- This command creates an index named `idx_lastname` on the `LastName` column of the `Students` table to speed up query performance involving this column.

#### Creating a View
```sql
CREATE VIEW StudentNames AS
SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Students;
```
- This command creates a view named `StudentNames` that includes only the `FirstName` and `LastName` columns from the `Students` table.

### 2. ALTER Command
The `ALTER` command is used to modify an existing database object. This includes adding, deleting, or modifying columns in a table, and changing the table structure.

#### Adding a Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE Students ADD COLUMN Email VARCHAR(100);
```
- Adds a new column `Email` to the `Students` table.

#### Modifying a Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE Students ALTER COLUMN LastName VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL;
```
- Changes the `LastName` column to allow up to 150 characters and ensures it cannot be null.

#### Dropping a Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE Students DROP COLUMN BirthDate;
```
- Removes the `BirthDate` column from the `Students` table.

### 3. DROP Command
The `DROP` command is used to delete database objects. This includes tables, databases, indexes, and views.

#### Dropping a Table
```sql
DROP TABLE Students;
```
- Deletes the `Students` table and all its data.

#### Dropping a Database
```sql
DROP DATABASE SchoolDB;
```
- Deletes the `SchoolDB` database and all its contained objects.

#### Dropping an Index
```sql
DROP INDEX idx_lastname;
```
- Deletes the index `idx_lastname` from the database.

#### Dropping a View
```sql
DROP VIEW StudentNames;
```
- Deletes the `StudentNames` view.

### 4. RENAME Command
The `RENAME` command is used to change the name of a database object.

#### Renaming a Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE Students RENAME TO Pupils;
```
- Changes the name of the table `Students` to `Pupils`.

### 5. TRUNCATE Command
The `TRUNCATE` command is used to delete all rows from a table without removing the table structure. It's faster than `DELETE` without a `WHERE` clause because it doesn't generate individual row delete actions and logging.

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE Students;
```
- Removes all rows from the `Students` table, but the table structure remains intact.

### Constraints
Constraints are rules enforced on data columns to ensure data integrity. Common constraints include:

- **PRIMARY KEY**: Ensures that each row in a table is unique and not null.
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Classes (
      ClassID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      ClassName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
  );
  ```

- **FOREIGN KEY**: Ensures referential integrity between tables.
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Enrollments (
      EnrollmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      StudentID INT,
      ClassID INT,
      FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students(StudentID),
      FOREIGN KEY (ClassID) REFERENCES Classes(ClassID)
  );
  ```

- **UNIQUE**: Ensures all values in a column are unique.
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE Students ADD CONSTRAINT UC_Email UNIQUE (Email);
  ```

- **NOT NULL**: Ensures that a column cannot have a null value.
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE Students ALTER COLUMN LastName SET NOT NULL;
  ```

- **CHECK**: Ensures that all values in a column satisfy a specific condition.
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Products (
      ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      Price DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (Price > 0)
  );
  ```

### Summary
DDL commands are essential for creating and maintaining the structure of a relational database. They allow you to define the schema, enforce data integrity, and make structural changes as needed. Proper use of DDL commands ensures that the database remains organized and efficient, supporting robust data management and retrieval.
